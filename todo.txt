1. Clean up the notebook, especially:
- Data processing/cleaning
- Neural network not as an afterthought
- Modularize cleaning functions
- GET RID OF INTERMEDIATE DATAFRAMES

2. Build a dashboard

3. Consider modularizing code into several .py files rather than one .ipynb?

Specific note: Geopandas cell is broken in notebook. Some new geopandas update broke a thing called "fiona". Search for "fiona" in notebook to find the cell I'm referring to.
